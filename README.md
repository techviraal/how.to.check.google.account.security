If you use your Google account to authenticate with services and devices, you should perform a Google security checkup frequently. You can do this by accessing the Google Account Security page where you can see the current status for all of the following security issues on your account.

1. Google constantly monitors where sign-in attempts occur. If an attempt is from a location you don't normally visit or a device you don't normally use, you'll see a "suspicious attempt to sign in" alert in this section.

If you don't recognize the sign-in attempt, select No, it wasn't me so that Google knows to block any future login attempts from that app or device.

2. Review the list of previous app or device sign-in attempts below this. If you see any that you don't recognize, select Don't recognize an event? at the bottom of the list. This will provide a pop-up where you can select Change password to sign out all devices and apps.

3. Once you've resolved any security issues, the checkmark beside the section will turn green, meaning there are no security issues.
